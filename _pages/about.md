**Code:** My main language is Python. I gained great experience by building infrastructures for ML models, which can be easily modified via configs and command line interface. 

**Research:** My current interests are generative modeling based on physics and geometry. This is primarily determined by recent advances in generative modeling. Specifically, framework of diffusion consisting of closely related markov chains, stochastic ode and langevin dynamics. I believe that solution for coherence of representation of long can be found via analysis through fundamental physics law of continuation and motion. 

**Education** In 2022 I received my Bachelor in Math and Physics in [MIPT](https://eng.mipt.ru/) university in Moscow,Russia. 

**Hobbies**: In my free time I like to practice Jiu Jitusu ðŸ¥‹ and play acoustic guitar.
