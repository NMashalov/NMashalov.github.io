## Intuition

Concept of manifold is difficult, due it's abstract mathematical deffinition.

| *Rigid body lattice* |

As observer it's hard to judge the earth is approximatelly a sphere. Yet that conjuction is essential for building 

So it said, manifold helps to build intuition on surface from it's local observation.

## Introduction

We'll start graph, which serves for same goal as manifold in discrete cases. Recall graph is just a collection of edges and

| *Graph is just a bundle of node and edges* |

Due to the one of the most important problems, how to find something. Suppose you are foreign city and you want to find supermarket.

|![graph.ong](/assets/img/posts/manifold/graph.excalidraw.png) |
|:--:|
| *Where I can buy food?* |

Let's find out it iteratively by visiting nearest streets. For that we use bread-search algorithm.

ou walk from your starting point - home and look around. When you'll observe supermarket. you'' build *optimal* path. In manifold studying it's called geodesics.

## Back to manifold


Locally manifold are just normal euclidian. It's like graph node stores in it's state.


Edges are named connection and defined via Cristofel $K$ and Levi-Civitia $\nabla$ symbols.

| *Nodes now Euclidian surface, edges Levi-Civitia symbols* |

As we understand from discrete representation we need to know to main things, how to measure distance for geodesics. For that   we need metric and

| *Tangent space* |


## Pushworward, pushback and pullback, s

Yet not all manifold are convenient to work about, therefore we can choose a better representation.

Connection between manifold of studying and better presentation is given map by map $f$.

|:--:|
| *Tangent space* |

We require from this map to be revertible for

| *Revert* |

For translation vector from tangent space we have pushforward transformations

|:--:|
| *Revert* |

Vector can change significantly after pushforawd operation: rotate and scales.

Exact transformation is given via pushforward Jacobian in exact point

$$
    J = \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_1} & 
    \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_2} & 
    \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_3} \\[1ex] % <-- 1ex more space between rows of matrix
  \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_1} & 
    \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_2} & 
    \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_3} \\[1ex]
  \frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_1} & 
    \frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_2} & 
    \frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_3}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

In manifold studying they will bring atlas. Similarity comes fact.

Finally, for metric needed for measuring


So than manifold
