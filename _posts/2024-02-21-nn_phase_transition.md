# Free energy


## Energy based approach 

Energy based defines probability as

$$
    p(E) = \frac{exp()}{Z}
$$


$Z$ - partition function .

# Renormalization

## Landau theory of phase transition

Main intuition is that radical changes of matter is connected with change of it's energetic

    H(X)
$$

$\Lambda$ is known is order parameter 

Coherency length

$$
    \xi 
$$
