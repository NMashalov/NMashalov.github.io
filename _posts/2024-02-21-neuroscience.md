Biological networks are much more than just scalar weights. It has activation time and phase different phases of work. Recent works have proved efficacy of neuro-informed approaches.

## Difference between biological and artifical neural nets

Neurons are interconnected with axons, which transmits signals between neurons. Signals are formed as spikes

## Latent representation

You can learn more about manifold in [blog](https://nmashalov.github.io/blog/2024/manifold/).

Hypothesis of latent representation is well studied and summarized via biological perspective in excellent videos of Artem Kirsanov [Neural manifolds - The Geometry of Behaviour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHj9uVmwA_0) and [Your brain is moving along the surface of the torus ðŸ¤¯](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujnZcaqf-4).

Latent representation are unique among all people. Yet we are capable to share via *communication*, which have certain formats. Through perspective of machine learning that is called [Sparse coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_dictionary_learning). That idea is very similar to basis in linear algebra.

| *Communication has lot's of forms* |

From experience of communication we learn to correspond specific communication as certain combination of semantic recognition.

### One more insight. Motion integrals

 When you sit in a train, you don't check to , you *just remember it*.

| *Communication has lot's of forms* |

From perspective of analytic mechanics it means that we coresponds to first integral. That means in your semantic space you can *decouple* preserving and changing.

 Moreover, we can say that through years we learn to do that with many things. We learn them an. That helps to concentrate on real

## How brain learns?

Backpropogation is highly successful algorithm for learning ANN (artificial neural nets), yet it doesn't have proper analogy with biological systems.



Work [Backpropagation and the brain](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-020-0277-3) Basically there are few hu


- Hebian learning. It forms the basis for unsupervised learning algorithms such as Hebbian networks and self-organizing maps (SOMs). These algorithms use the principle of strengthening connections between neurons that are frequently activated together, allowing the network to form representations of input patterns in an unsupervised manner.
- Perurbation

Effectiveness of backpropogation is connected with fact that instead of seeing result of perturbing of singular weight to see change of output it's possible. It comes necessity of integration and redirect attention towards stationary neural nets, which is not biologically plausible. Refer to [The recent excitement about neural networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/337129a0) to learn more about.


## Hopfield networks



Are tightly correspondent to Ising models of spin glasses

$$
    E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1}^n w_{ij} v_i v_j + \theta
$$

$v_i$ corresponds to spin orientation and hold values between

Hopfield networks are learned throught update rules which may me:

-  In synchronous updating, all neurons in the network update their states simultaneously at each time step.
- In asynchronous updating, only one neuron is updated at a time, chosen randomly or sequentially. The new state of the chosen neuron is calculated based on the current states of other neurons in the network.


Continious in time


$$
    \frac{d}{dt} u_i = \frac{-u_i}{\tau} + \sum_{j=1}^n w_{ij} + \theta_i
$$


### Spherical spin glass


Description mostly from paper by Yann LeCun The Loss Surfaces of Multilayer Networks
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0233.pdf. Work considers feed-forward deep network with single output for modeling.

Spherical constrain

$$
    \frac{1}{\Lambda} \sum_{i=1}^\Lambda w_i^2  = \mathrm{C}
$$



## Ensembles

Combinatorial representation of system as possible collections of states

Why we need lot's neuronms

Symmetry can exhibit various dimensions. Describing a rotation transformation in n-dimensional space requires a minimum of n-1 parameters. If represented as a matrix, the parameter space expands by a factor of n. Within a grid, this transformation is learned as a distinctive structure, which may further augment its complexity.

| *Example of high dimensional symmetry that embedded in 2 dimensional picture* |

Look at following picture. One of the symmetry that net might learn is that all cars, therefore they can be permuted without loss of sense.

$$
 P = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & \cdots & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 & \cdots & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

For learning such symmetries we high dimensional matrix, hence more neurons

## Neural coding

A way how brain transfer information.

## Liquid networks

Is's a conspect from [Liquid Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlliqYiRhMU)

Leaky-integrator model

$$
    \frac{d \mathbf{x}}{d t} = - \frac{\mathbf{x}(t)}{\tau} + \mathbf{S}(t)
$$


Conductance-based synapce model

$$
    \mathbf{S}(t) = f(\mathbf{x}(t),\mathbf{I}(t),t, \theta)(A - \mathbf{x}(t))
$$

$$
    \frac{d \mathbf{x}}{d t } = - \left[ \frac{1}{\tau} + \underbrace{f(\mathbf{x}(t,\mathbf{I}(t),t,\theta)}_{\text{Liquid variable}}) \right] \mathbf{x}(t) +  f(\mathbf{x}(t,\mathbf{I}(t),t,\theta)) A
$$

### New Hopfiled networks

Recall that are two type of states


Were introduced in Paper
Dense Associative Memory for Pattern Recognition
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164




Old pair-wise interaction

$$
    E = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1}^N \sigma_i T_{ij} \sigma_j
$$

New non-linear

$$
    E = - \sum_{\mu =1}^K F(\xi_i^\mu \sigma_i)
$$

Which comes in exponential increase in capacity of stored memories. 

With drawback of that we need to store all of them

Increased capacity of recognised
