Perhaps you have heard model VQ-VAE and VQ Gan that use quantization.

### Sparsity



Dictionary learning.

There are cases where wavelets or Fourier components are not good enough for restoration. In most cases we are aimed to build with as little parameters as possilbe.

 Often that happens due to the case that in specefic situation better basis can be introduced than general. Dictionary matching is way of introducing better basis, that comes from data



### Sparse learning


$$
    \|x_i - \mathbf{D} r_i \|_2^2  + \lambda \| r\|
$$

### Matching pursuit

Is quite simple algorithm that represent as linear sum


$$
    D = X R^+
$$

$+$ here means Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, which comes due to fact that dictonary can contain not orthogonal. So that determinant can be equal to zero, we need something more robust.
