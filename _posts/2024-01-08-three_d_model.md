Here's my overview of current achievements in 3D 


As pictures have several approaches like SVG and PNG 3d models also have different representation:
- mesh 
- voxel (3d pixel)
- NERF

Formats can be transformed

Most crucial equation comes. It's defined through density estimation

## NERF
Awesome overview of NERF are presented in [AI SUMMER](https://theaisummer.com/nerf/)
