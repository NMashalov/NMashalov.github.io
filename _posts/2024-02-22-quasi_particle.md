Main thesis: neural net can be viewed as freezing. Under very low temperature matter changes and quantum effect appears. 

## Rigid body theory


Rigid body is built from latices

Points of lattice are field with positive atom kernel and are covered with dust of electrons

Phonon is representation of lattice perturbation. They helps to build mechanical intuition of phase transitions.

Most notoriously for statistical description is that. Therefore it's permuttative. That brings insights about energy distribution of particles/

### Quasi Particles

### Bose einstein condesat

All particles are placed at lowest energy level with gap to another big enough

Superfluid is matter that doesn't have vicosity. It means it doesn't have friction with surface along with it's traveling.

Actually, that wasn't true. It happens that there is special speed called Landau speed under which rotons start to

In very low temperatures.

Most essential is a gap between level of excitation.





Superfluidity comes due to fact that quasiparticles doesn't have enough

### Explanation of superconductivity



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogoliubov_transformation

Сurrent in conductors is built from unpaired electrons, that travels freely through lattice of matter. Stream of such electrons builds current

Resistance of conductor comes from fact that lattice starts to vibrate under stream. Such vibrations can represented as phonons, which 

Literally, their interaction can be rewriten in motion mechanics maneer

$$
    k + k' = k\\
    E + E  = E
$$

Electron scattering in flow results in resistance. You can even achieve exact formula.

Key insights:
- if something has resistance it means there are some mechanism of scattering of stream
  
Let's try to apply to neural net.

Resistance here is connected with fact that nets need to learn

Local minimas - are scattering and can be replaced with "gradions" - quasiparticles that scatters gradient descent.s

Yet electrons in streams meet other particles called phonons. It's nature comes from reaction of lattice due to distortion.

Small distortion builds harmonic occillations.
